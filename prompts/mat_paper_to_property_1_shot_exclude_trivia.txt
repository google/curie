You are a materials scientist. Your goal is to find and extract all numeric values or numeric value ranges of material properties mentioned or tabulated in a given paper text.

The output should be in json format:
[
  {
    "material": "<material name>",
    "material_descriptor": "<material descriptor>",
    "material_source_passage": "<source passage from which the material name and descriptor were identified>",
    "material_source_table": "<source table from which the material name and descriptor were identified>",
    "property_name": "<property name>",
    "property_descriptor": "<property descriptor>",
    "property_source_passage": "<source passage from which material name, property and property descriptor were identified>",
    "property_source_table": "<source table from which material name, property and property descriptor were identified>",
    "low_value" : "<low value>",
    "high_value": "<high value>",
    "value_units": "<value units>",
    "value_source_passage": "<source passage from which material property values were identified>",
    "value_source_table": "<source table from which material property values were identified>",
  }, ...
]

An example of the output is as follows:
[
  {
    "material":"HfO<sub>2<\/sub>",
    "material_descriptor":"films\natomic layer deposition\nThickness 9.80 nm",
    "material_source_passage":"Figure 2a shows the refractive index n as a function of photon energy for all samples as deduced from the analysis of the SE results. The n value for HfO<sub>2<\/sub> measured at 550-nm (2.26 eV) wavelength is 1.84, which is similar with the previous report [20].",
    "material_source_table":"1",
    "property_name":"refractive index\nn\nindex of refraction",
    "property_descriptor":"Wavelength 550 nm\nphoton energy 2.26 eV\nGaussian dispersion model",
    "property_source_passage":"Figure 2a shows the refractive index n as a function of photon energy for all samples as deduced from the analysis of the SE results. The n value for HfO<sub>2<\/sub> measured at 550-nm (2.26 eV) wavelength is 1.84, which is similar with the previous report [20].",
    "property_source_table":"",
    "low_value":"1.84",
    "high_value":"1.84",
    "value_units":"",
    "value_source_passage":"Figure 2a shows the refractive index n as a function of photon energy for all samples as deduced from the analysis of the SE results. The n value for HfO<sub>2<\/sub> measured at 550-nm (2.26 eV) wavelength is 1.84, which is similar with the previous report [20].",
    "value_source_table":"",
  }, ...
]

There are some certain rules you need to follow:
1. Be thorough! Don't miss even a single numeric value.
2. Avoid null low_value and high_value. Simply skip the entry if you cannot extract the numeric value.
3. If a value is only extractable from a figure, not text or table, simply skip that entry.
4. Make sure whatever low_value and high_value actually exists in the sourcepassage or refered table.
5. If one passage contains multiple materials or properties, record all of them as separate entries.
6. If different values are mentioned for the same material property, record all of them as separate entries.
7. Material, property, and value may or may not be mentioned in the same passage.
8. Only extract real physical or chemical properties that are important and relevant. Do not include trivia in your output, such as geometries.
