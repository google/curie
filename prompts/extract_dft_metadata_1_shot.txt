A materials scientist would like to reproduce the DFT calculations from a paper.
They want detailed information about each of the DFT calculations in the paper.
Output a list of the distinct DFT parameters with fields including, \
but not limited to, "software", "functional", "k-points-grid", "pseudopotentials", \
"basis_set", "energy_cutoff", "energy_convergence", "force_convergence", "relaxed_nuclei", \
"relaxed_unit_cell", "spin", "hubbard_U". \
If a structure is relaxed, please set "relaxed_nuclei" or "relaxed_unit_cell" \
to 1.0 (corresponding to true). \
If spin is involved in the calculation, set "spin" to 1.0 \
Include the units in these fields if applicable. \
If any information is relevant but missing, input "NaN" in the field. \
If any information is irrelevant and missing, input "NaN" in the field. \
Make sure to write your output in JSON format. \
Include any related information to the that has not been covered into the "other_information" field.

Use the following format:
[

   "function_name":"short_function_description",
   "software": "Specify which software was used, e.g. vasp, gaussian, castep, qe, dmol, orca, wein2k",

Here is an example excerpt, and the output:
Example excerpt:
We performed the projector augmented wave (PAW) based spin-polarized simulations using the Vienna
ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [40], [41]. The STO has 5 atoms (1 Sr, 1 Ti and 3 O) in its
unit cell. We considered a 2x2x2 supercell consisting of 40 atoms for all simulations presented in
this article. The electronic configuration of STO is divided into valence and core to facilitate
the PAW. We considered 10 electrons of Sr (4s24p65p2), 10 electrons of Ti (3p63d24s2) and 6
electrons of O (2s22p4) as valence electrons (in total 26 valence electrons) and the rest were
modelled as frozen core. We replaced the 3d-TM Ti with 5d-TM Pt in case of the Pt-doped STO.
We used 6 × 6 × 6 Monkhorst Pack grid k-points mesh to sample the Brillouin zone (BZ). The kinetic
energy cutoff for plane waves was 540 eV.

To understand the electronic properties of undoped STO, we simulated the
spin-polarized total density of states (TDOS) within a 14 eV energy window centred at the Fermi
level (E_F) for HSE06 functional as displayed in Fig. 1(a, b). The atomic density of states (DOS)
confirms the dominance of O and Ti atoms in contributing to the electronic states near VBM and CBm
respectively as displayed in Fig. 1(a). For the electronic band structure (BS), we
considered the high symmetry points Γ, R, X and M in the Brillouin zone (BZ) of the cubic STO
within the energy range from −8 to 8 eV centred at E_F, see Fig. 2. The HSE06 produced band gaps of
both direct (3.66 eV at Γ ) and indirect (3.25 eV at R) nature which are in excellent agreement
with the experimental observations of direct (indirect) band gap of 3.75 eV (3.25 eV) found in Ref. [4].
Pt-doped STO was found to be metallic.
