A materials scientist would like to reproduce the DFT calculations from a paper.
They want to identify the input structures, and gather as much information about the structures as possible. \

Make sure to identify all input structures, and output a list of the distinct input structures information with fields \
"id", "common_name", "scientific_name", "type", "composition", "description", "vacuum_x", "vacuum_y", "vacuum_z", "supercell", "cas_number", "lattice_a", "lattice_b", "lattice_c", "space group", "orientation", "mp_id", "isomer_name". \
The "id" field is just a string of format "structure_metadata_{number}", where {number} starts from 1 and indicates the order the structure appears in the excerpt. \
The "description" field should capture all relevant information that is not captured by the other fields. Make sure to write your output as a list of dictionaries, NOT A BULLETED LIST. \
The "common_name" field should have the common name of the material and "scientific_name" should have the formal scientific name of the material. \
The "type" field should point out whether the material is a molecule, a protein, a bulk crystal structure, a thin film or something else. \
If the structure has vacuum around it, please include the thickness of vacuum layer in three directions with units in these fields: "vacuum_x", "vacuum_y", "vacuum_z". \
The fields "lattice_a", "lattice_b", "lattice_c" correspond to the lattice parameters of the unit cell. Include units in these fields as well. Leave them blank if lattice parameters are missing. \
The "supercell" field should tell how many times the unit cell is repeated in the [x, y, z] directions, like "2x2x2". \
If the text indicates the material structure is from material project and provides a "mp_id", please include that in the field "mp_id".
If the structure has multiple isomers and the text mentions which is used, please indicate that in the field "isomer_name". \
If any information is relevant but missing, input "UNKNOWN" in the field. If any information is irrelevant and missing, input None in the field. \
The "description" field should capture all relevant information that is not captured by the other fields. Make sure to write your output as a list of dictionaries, NOT A BULLETED LIST.

This is an example excerpt and the output:
Example excerpt:
We performed the projector augmented wave (PAW) based spin-polarized simulations using the Vienna
ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [40], [41]. The STO has 5 atoms (1 Sr, 1 Ti and 3 O) in its
unit cell. We considered a 2x2x2 supercell consisting of 40 atoms for all simulations presented in
this article. The electronic configuration of STO is divided into valence and core to facilitate
the PAW. We considered 10 electrons of Sr (4s24p65p2), 10 electrons of Ti (3p63d24s2) and 6
electrons of O (2s22p4) as valence electrons (in total 26 valence electrons) and the rest were
modelled as frozen core. In cases of doped STO, we considered Pt-5d96s1, S-3s23p4 and Se-4s24p6 as
valence electrons. We replaced the 3d-TM Ti with 5d-TM Pt in case of the Pt-doped STO.
