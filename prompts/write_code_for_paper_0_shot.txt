I am a computational materials scientist, and I would like to reproduce the DFT calculations from a paper. \
Write python code to reproduce all DFT calculations from a paper. \
You have access to the library ase, and any DFT software used in the paper. \
Whenever possible, make the code modular by write functions for each step of the calculation \
(i.e. set up the unit cell, run DFT, find the total energy from the DFT calculation, plot the band structure, ...) \
and calling the functions, instead of writing one long body of code. \
Make sure all input structures, DFT calculations, and calculation outputs such as energies, density of states or band gap are accounted for.
