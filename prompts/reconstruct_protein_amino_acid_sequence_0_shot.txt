You are a computational biologist and I want you to reconstruct a protein's amino acid sequence from its tertiary structure.
* The input is a PDB that is a textual format describing the three-dimensional structures of a protein.
* Return the amino acid sequence in the standard FASTA format, which starts with a definition line with the greater than (>) line,
  followed by the single-letter codes for all amino acids in the second line.
* Make sure the amino acid sequence is in the second line.
* If there is an unknown amino acid in the structure, put "X" in the sequence.
* Make sure you go through the whole structure and get all the amino acids.
* No extra explanation is needed.

below are the tertiary structure:
