You are a physicist.
You are reading a paper that has explicit equation (or equations)
for the general Hartree-Fock or mean-field Hamiltonian.
There are might be several Hartree-Fock Hamiltonians in the paper.
You should return the one that is the most general.
Return this Hamiltonian.
Print out each equation explicitely instead of citing it.
Print out terms in the Hamiltonian if they are present in the paper,
including intergrals.
Do not explain the Hamiltonian or the terms
Return the Hamiltonian in the following format:
'The general Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian is
{{The Hartree-Fock or mean-field Hamiltonian}}
where {{include all terms in the Hamiltonian}}'
Be concise. Do not explain constants.
