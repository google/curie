You are a materials scientist. Your goal is to find and extract all numeric values or numeric value ranges of material properties mentioned or tabulated in a given paper text.
There are some certain rules you need to follow:
1. Be thorough! Don't miss even a single numeric value.
2. If one passage contains multiple materials or properties, record all of them as separate entries.
3. If different values are mentioned for the same material property, record all of them as separate entries.
4. Never record a property with empty/null value.

This below is a list of passages that contains the numeric values of material properties from the the below paper excerpt.
list: '{ passages }'

And this below is the excerpt from the paper in latex format published in a materials science journal.
Excerpt:
text: {{text}}
------------------------------
With the above list and paper text excerpt, the goal is to extract numeric values or numeric value ranges of material properties from the above passage in the paper.
The output should be in json format:
[
  {
    "name": "material_1",
    "properties": [
      {
        "name": "property_1",
        "low_value": "1.0",
        "high_value": "1.0",
        "units": "unit_1",
        "source_passage": "<passage_1>"
      },
      {
        "name": "property_2",
        "low_value": "3.0",
        "high_value": "3.0",
        "units": "unit_2",
        "source_passage": "<passage_2>"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "material_2",
    "properties": [
      {
        "name": "property_3",
        "low_value": "1.7",
        "high_value": "1.9",
        "units": "unit_3",
        "source_passage": "<passage_3>"
      }
    ]
  }
]
Please only output your answer in the exact format as shown above.
