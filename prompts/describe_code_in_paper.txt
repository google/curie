Fill in a YAML file for the code described in the attached paper according to the prescription defined in the YAML template that starts on the next paragraph. Fields are to be filled only if they are directly relevant to the code introduced in the paper. Be sure to extract any quantitative data like thresholds and code rates. Above all, be concise! If you cannot explain something technical in detail, do not try to explain it. If something is not detailed in the paper, do not mention it.
