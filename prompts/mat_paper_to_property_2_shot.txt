Correlation of Raman and X-ray diffraction measurements of annealed pulsed laser deposited ZnO thin films

abstract
Abstract Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry and atomic force microscopy have been used to characterise ZnO thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition as a function of the post-growth annealing temperature. The results show substantial enhancement and broadening of certain Raman features which correlate excellently with the change in width of the X-ray diffraction peaks. The 570 cm −1 Raman feature showed pronounced asymmetry and enhanced intensity in the unannealed sample. An increase in grain size observed after subsequent annealing produced a substantial reduction in both the asymmetry and intensity of this peak. Our experimental data suggest that electric fields, due to charge trapping at grain boundaries, in conjunction with localised and surface phonon modes are the cause of the intensity enhancement and asymmetry of this feature.

Introduction
Recent years have seen a renewed interest in the II-VI semiconductor ZnO (direct bandgap ~3.3 eV). ZnO crystallises in the wurzite lattice, is optically transparent with a large exciton binding energy of 60 meV, and is capable of UV emission and lasing. ZnO is normally n-type, but p-type ZnO has been grown which has contributed significantly to the fabrication of UV / blue LED's and laser diodes. Recently ZnO nanowires have shown UV lasing under optical pumping, and fabrication of a homostructural ZnO p-n junction has been reported [see e.g. ref. [1] [2] [3] .
In this study Raman Spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed to characterise thin films grown using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and annealed in situ at various temperatures. Our data allow us to firmly identify the mechanism responsible for enhancement of the 570 cm -1 Raman feature observed in polycrystalline samples.

Experimental Details
ZnO films were grown on (0001) sapphire substrates by PLD using a 10 Hz pulsed KrF excimer laser (λ=248 nm). The fluence on target was set at 1.7 J/cm 2 for all samples. A ZnO ceramic target (99.99%) was used throughout. The target to substrate distance was ~ 4 cm. The thin films were grown in an O 2 (purity 99.99%) pressure of 0.3 mbar and the substrate temperature was maintained at 400°C during growth. Typically the films were 150-200 nm, giving a deposition rate of 0.025nm/pulse. The films were subsequently annealed in O 2 (0.3 mbar) between 400°C and 600°C (see Table 1 ) in the growth chamber immediately after deposition. SEM data show that the films are continuous and show no evidence of porosity. The crystal structure and quality of the samples were investigated by XRD in the θ-2θ mode (Siemens D500 using Cu K α radiation). Raman scattering measurements were performed using a micro-Raman spectrometer equipped with a CCD detector. Raman spectra were excited with 1.96 eV photons from a He-Ne laser (λ~632 nm) or, for the resonance excitation measurements, with 3.82 eV photons from a UV laser (λ=325 nm), in both cases using back scattering geometry. The He-Ne laser beam of 5-6 mW was focussed on the sample surface to a spot of diameter ~ 10 μm.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were made using a commercial AFM in contact mode operation. identical within the limits of our experimental accuracy (± 0.001 nm). The average grain size (parallel to the (0002) direction) of the ZnO films can be estimated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (0002) peak using Scherrer's relation [5] (see Table 1 ). The range of annealing temperatures used in our work coincides with those known to lead to major grain growth [6] [7] . The annealed samples show a decrease of (0002) peak FWHM and consequent increase in grain size with increasing annealing temperature. These results are supported by AFM imaging of the samples (figure 2), where measurements of the lateral grain sizes are 135 ± 40 nm for the sample annealed at 400 0 C and 180 ± 50 nm for the sample annealed at 500 0 C. The annealing process clearly produces a recovery of the crystal structure and increase of the grain size. We note that in our experimental conditions, the increase in grain size is achieved after annealing for relatively short times. Such an effect was also observed in the case of magnetron sputtered ZnO [8] .
The unpolarized Raman spectra (with He-Ne excitation) of the ZnO thin films are shown in figure 3 as a function of annealing temperature. The peaks at 418 cm -1 and 751 cm -1 are due to scattering from the sapphire substrate. The E 2 437cm -1 peak, characteristic of the wurtzite lattice, can be seen in all samples. The A 1 (TO) mode at 379 cm -1 is apparent in samples c and d. However, the Raman spectra are dominated by the longitudinal optical vibration at ~570cm -1 . This band is attributed to the E 1 (LO) mode [9] . The intensity and FWHM of the 570 cm -1 peak appears anomalously high for the unannealed sample and the sample (b) which was annealed at 400 0 C, but it is reduced dramatically (by a factor of ~100 relative to the sapphire features) with increasing annealing temperature. In addition, this feature shows a marked asymmetry which also decreases with increasing annealing temperature. Raman spectra were also measured with UV excitation λ=325 nm (or 3.82eV) and are shown in figure 4 . The spectra from all the samples are similar, that is the strong band at 570 cm -1 was observed below the 800 cm -1 spectral region whereas a 2LO vibrational mode at ~1150 cm -1 was recorded in the higher spectral range as reported by several authors [10] [11] . The Raman peak at 570 cm -1 is symmetric for all the PLD-grown ZnO samples when the excitation is at or above resonance.

Discussion
We observe a clear correlation between the XRD data and the corresponding nonresonant Raman spectra as a function of annealing temperature. As the average grain size increases, we observe a reduction in the relative intensity and asymmetry of the 570 cm -1 band in the Raman spectra. The intensity and asymmetry of the LO mode at 570cm -1 has been widely discussed in the literature. Explanations for this structure include resonance enhancement due to impurity levels in the band gap [12] , contributions from both the A 1 (LO) and E 1 (LO) modes due to random crystallite orientation [12] or a combination of electric field induced (EFI) Raman enhancement and one of the following mechanisms (i) coupled phonon-plasmon scattering or (ii) localised interface and/or surface phonon modes [13] .
The absence of the characteristic 2 nd , 3 rd order scattering in our spectra rules out the resonant enhancement by levels in the gap. These are observed in the spectra of the samples under UV excitation as expected. Contributions from both the A 1 (LO) and E 1 (LO) modes due to random crystallite orientation can also be ruled out for the reasons given by Exarhos and Sharma [12] , namely that, after annealing the XRD results remain essentially the same, except for a reduction in the FWHM of the peaks, with no evidence for substantial crystallite reorientation. In addition this cannot explain the abnormally high intensity of the 570 cm -1 band in samples (a) and (b) in particular. Phonon-plasmon coupling is known to produce significant line shifts and broadening in Raman spectra.
However, for highly polycrystalline material, the contribution of the lower frequency L -mode is generally absent, and a shift and broadening to higher energy of the L + mode is observed. This behaviour is not seen in our samples, hence we believe that the line broadening we observe is unlikely to be due to phonon-plasmon coupling.
The most consistent explanation of the behaviour of our Raman data is in terms of EFI enhancement (via charge trapping at grain boundaries) of the 570cm -1 feature [13] . This enhancement effect in conjunction with the presence of localised/surface phonon modes, which arise due to the small grain size, accounts for both the intensity and asymmetry of the peak in the unannealed sample [13] . Surface phonon modes have been reported at ~550cm -1 in ZnO [14] , which is close to the low energy side of the broad LO mode. In the annealed samples, the increase in the grain size reduces the grain boundary density and hence the effects of charge trapping at grain boundaries. Consequently the EFI enhancement is substantially reduced, in addition to elimination of the surface/interface modes. The importance of band bending at grain boundaries in polycrystalline samples and the presence of strong electric fields has also been found in studies of varistor action in ZnO [15] and of the green luminescence mechanism [16] . Similar enhancement and asymmetry effects have also been observed in the Raman scattering of ZnO containing gold colloids [17] . These were attributed to a surface enhancement effect caused by anomalously large electric fields due to the colloid plasmon resonance. Thus, our data appear to support the model proposed in ref. [13] . This suggests that the enhancement and sample. An increase in the grain size and reduction in the electric field intensity due to annealing lead to a decrease in the intensity and asymmetry of the LO mode.

SiC formation for a solar cell passivation layer using an RF magnetron co-sputtering system

abstract
In this paper, we describe a method of amorphous silicon carbide film formation for a solar cell passivation layer. The film was deposited on p-type silicon (100) and glass substrates by an RF magnetron co-sputtering system using a Si target and a C target at a room-temperature condition. Several different SiC [Si1-xCx] film compositions were achieved by controlling the Si target power with a fixed C target power at 150 W. Then, structural, optical, and electrical properties of the Si1-xCx films were studied. The structural properties were investigated by transmission electron microscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry. The optical properties were achieved by UV-visible spectroscopy and ellipsometry. The performance of Si1-xCx passivation was explored by carrier lifetime measurement.

Introduction
Semiconductor technology or microelectronics including solar cells has been adopted to form micro-or nanosized state-of-the-art structures which can reduce system size, improve its performance, achieve lower system cost, and so on [1] [2] [3] . Generally, a semiconductor structure or system is manufactured by a combination of additive (film deposition) and subtractive (etching) processes. These days, many research have tried to utilize the microelectronic technology (especially in the deposition of thin film layers) to get more efficient and costeffective solar cells [4, 5] .
Amorphous silicon-based thin film layers (SiO 2 , SiN, a-SiC:H, and so on) for antireflection coatings, diffusion barriers, passivation layers, and silicon bulk materials have been broadly researched in the solar cell industry. Among the film layers, SiO 2 and SiN passivation layers have highly attracted to fabricate high-efficiency silicon solar cells. However, they have negative demerits such as the need for a high-temperature process, difficulty in the photolithography process, and poor thermal stability [6] [7] [8] . Hydrogenated amorphous silicon carbide [a-SiC: H] has been studied for solar cell passivation layers due to its wide bandgap, excellent coefficient of thermal expansion that matches with silicon wafers, relatively good thermal and mechanical stabilities, superior costof-ownership compared to other materials, and so on. The formation or deposition of the a-SiC:H film has mainly been done by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition [9, 10] . However, the thermal stability of the hydrogen-containing film is degraded during a posthigh-temperature firing process. To avoid the hydrogen molecule's void generation, the authors have proposed an a-SiC deposition method by radio frequency [RF] sputtering which was performed by a single silicon-carbide composite target in an argon environment [10] . In this paper, we introduce a deposition method of amorphous silicon carbide [a-Si 1-x C x ] which was done by RF magnetron co-sputtering. The method can utilize multiple targets (in this paper, Si and C) simultaneously in order to deposit complex compositional coatings. The compositional ratio can be controlled by the differences in sputtering yield, the relative ability of the materials to stick to the substrate, the deposition temperature, and the relevant percent of sputtered elements to reach the substrate without being scattered from the plasma. In this paper, we investigate several properties of the compositional films by controlling the Si target's RF power. Film thickness was measured using a field-emission scanning electron microscope [FE-SEM] . Reflective index of the film was obtained using an ellipsometer, and carrier lifetime of the film on the doped p-type silicon wafer was obtained by a silicon wafer lifetime tester.

Experimental details
The a-Si 1-x C x passivation layer was deposited on 2 × 7-cm glass substrates and 4-inch p-type silicon (100) wafers using an RF magnetron co-sputtering system. Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of our RF magnetron co-sputtering system. Before the RF plasma process, the substrates were cleaned in trichloroethylene, acetone, methanol, and distilled water for 10 min. For the silicon wafers, an acid treatment was added for 45 s. Pure (99.9%), 4-inch Si and C targets were installed to achieve a high-quality a-Si 1-x C x passivation layer. The sputtering chamber was vacuumed up to the base pressure of 1 × 10 -5 Torr using a turbomolecular pump. A highly pure (99.9999%) argon environment was established for the deposition with a flow of 40 sccm. Then, the Si and C targets were pre-sputtered to clean the target surface and the chamber for 10 min. The target-tosubstrate distance and the substrate rotation speed were fixed for all depositions as 6 cm and 1, 700 rph, respectively. In this work, to check the effect of the Si-to-C ratio on the a-Si 1-x C x passivation layers, the RF power of the C target was fixed at 150 W, and several different RF powers (100, 150, 175, and 200 W) of the Si target were applied to. However, the thicknesses of all a-Si 1-x C x passivation layers were kept constant at 100 nm by controlling the deposition rate. The deposition rates with the different RF powers of the Si target were summarized in Figure 2 , and the detailed experimental parameters were summarized in Table 1 .
The deposited a-Si 1-x C x passivation layer's thickness and crystal structure were measured using an FE-SEM (S-4800, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) and a transmission electron microscope [TEM] (JEM-2100F, JEOL, Seoul, South Korea), respectively. Optical properties of the transmittance and bandgap were measured by UV-visible spectroscopy (S-3100, Scinco, Seoul, South Korea), the refractive indexes were obtained using an ellipsometer (M2000D, Woollam, Uiwang-si, South Korea), and the electrical performance of the a-Si 1-x C x passivation layer was analyzed by carrier lifetime measurement (WCT-120, Sinton Consulting Inc., Boulder, CO, USA).

Results and discussion
As mentioned in the 'Experimental details' section, the film thickness was fixed at 100 nm. The thickness was measured with three different apparatuses, such as FE-SEM, TEM, and secondary ion mass spectrometer [SIMS] . Figure 3 shows cross-sectional bright field TEM images with a variation on the RF power of the silicon target. As the RF power of the Si target goes higher, the color of the Si1-xCx film gets darker due to the Si-rich compositional ratio of the film. It may indicate that the compositional ratio of the SiC is changed by the RF target power of the element. SIMS is widely used in the profile distribution of compositional elements along the deposited film depth by detecting the ionized element's mass. Figure 4 shows the depth profiles of Si and C along the deposited film. By increasing the RF power of the Si target, the mass intensity of the silicon particle gets higher than that of carbon. When we applied the same RF power on both targets, the compositional ratio of the elements seems to be 50:50 in mass intensity. When it goes deeper near the p-type silicon surface region, the carbon intensity is decreased abruptly. The falling point of the carbon intensity indicated the thickness of the a-Si1-xCx film with a sharp boundary between the film and the substrate. Figure 5a shows the refractive index spectra of the aSi 1-x C x passivation films measured using an ellipsometer as a function of the Si target's RF power. The refractive indexes in the wavelength range of 400 to 1, 000 nm are increased when a higher RF power of the Si target is applied. At a 200-W RF power of the Si target, the refractive index value is highest all over the wavelength range. Generally, the refractive index of Si is higher than that of C (Si ≈ 3.49, C ≈ 2.41 at 630 nm). Therefore, when the RF power of the Si target goes up, more Si ions are deposited on the film. This Si-rich film makes a higher refractive layer. Figure 5b describes one point of refractive index at 630 nm which is a standard wavelength for optical properties in the visible wavelength regime and is a red-light wavelength. We obtained a refractive index of 2.7 at the 100-W RF power of the Si target. Then, by increasing the RF power of the Si target, the refractive index goes up, and at the 200-W RF power, we achieved the highest refractive index of 3.7. This result has a very similar trend with our previous experiment which was done with a single SiC composite target [5] . The previous result has a very narrow refractive index variation (3.2 to 3.4) with the change of a large RF power range (150 to 300 W), but co-sputtering method shows a relatively large refractive index variation (2.7 to 3.7). That is, we have more controllability of the refractive index selection for the passivation layer.
The optical bandgaps were calculated from optical absorption measurement of the thin films which were deposited on the glass substrates. The optical absorptions were obtained from the intensity of the light measured by UV-visible spectroscopy [11] . Then, the optical bandgaps of the films were determined by the Tauc plot method which was performed by extrapolating the linear part of the absorption vs. photon energy (αhν) 1/2 curves [12, 13] . Figure 6 shows the optical bandgap as a function of the RF power of the Si target. The absorption bandgaps are decreased from 1.4 to 0.9 eV as the RF power of the Si target is increasing. In general, the optical bandgap of carbon (≈5.5 eV at room temperature [RT]) has a much higher value than that of Si (≈1.11 eV at RT). When the Si target power is increasing, the film is changed to a Si-abundant layer. Therefore, it is reasonable that the higher RF power of the Si target brings a thin film with a lower optical bandgap. Figure 7 shows the carrier lifetime of the a-SiC passivation layer measured by a silicon wafer lifetime tester with the function of Si target power. The carrier lifetime of the passivation layer deposited with a 100-W Si target power was 8.9 μs. Samnanta et al. reported that impurity in the semiconductor can degrade the lifetime by the creation of an electrical defect center or crystal imperfection [14] . Therefore, a carbon-rich thin layer can have more microdefects than a Si-rich film. In our study, the carrier lifetime was gradually decreased from 8.9 to 6.0 as the RF power of the Si target is increased from 100 to 200 W.

Conclusions
We demonstrate a formation method of an a-Si 1-x C x passivation layer for Si solar cells. The method was performed by RF magnetron co-sputtering with a Si target and a C target. The a-Si 1-x C x passivation layer was deposited on p-type silicon (100) and glass substrates with the reaction of argon (Ar) gas. In this work, we have checked the effect of the Si-to-C ratio on the a-Si 1- x C x passivation layers with variation on the RF powers of the Si target (100, 150, 175, and 200 W) and with fixation on the RF power of the C target (150 W). However, the thicknesses of all a-Si 1-x C x passivation layers were kept constant at 100 nm. The SIMS profile showed that the film composition is changed with a variation on the RF power of the Si target. The refractive index analysis indicated that a Si-rich thin film has higher refractive index. We could obtain the highest refractive index of 3.7 with a 200-W RF power of the Si target. The optical bandgap analysis showed that the bandgap of the Tauc plot was observed to decrease gradually from 1.4 to 0.9 eV. The carrier lifetime analysis showed that the carrier lifetime of the a-Si 1-x C x passivation layer was observed to decrease gradually from 8.9 to 6.0 μs as the carbon ratio in the film is decreased by changing the Si target power. Therefore, we could conclude that the RF magnetron co-sputtering method for SiC can deposit a thin film passivation layer for solar cells with various compositional ratios of Si and C.

The sputtering chamber was vacuumed up to the base pressure of 1 × 10<sup>-5</sup> Torr using a turbomolecular pump.
