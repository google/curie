For the following figure and caption, please return the WGS84 latitude and longitude bounding box coordinates of the map in the image.
If there are multiple maps of the same region, please just return only one answer.
If two areas are represented, and one is an inset of the other, return the smaller of the two areas.
If you are not sure, please guess at an answer anyway. I'd rather have an answer than no answer at all.
Make sure to return decimal coordinates in range [-90, 90] for latitude and (-180, 180] for longitude.
Please put your answer in the following JSON format:
{
    "W": <west>,
    "S": <south>,
    "E": <east>,
    "N": <north>
}
Please return only the JSON output.
Here is the image and caption.
